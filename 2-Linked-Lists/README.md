# Linked Lists

## Singly Linked Lists
A singly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node stores a reference (or link) to an object and a reference to the next node in the sequence. In a singly linked list, the last node typically has a reference to null to signify the end of the list. Each node contains two fields: data and a next node reference.
